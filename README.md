Thanks for checking out my little python app. :D

The purpose of this program is to take the wonderful information available on https://dunestatus.com/?type=public and provide live updates on a specific world and sietch from it so you can see when the hagga basin you want to join unlocks.

When launching the program it will ask you which region, world, and sietch you wish to monitor, while it isn't case sensitive, make sure you type these in correctly. After clicking OK a line graph will show up which is monitoring the capacity of the sietch, this fluxuates depending on the player activity on that specific sietch and will slowly go down if the sietch has light activity for a while. If it drops below 100% then the sietch will unlock allowing a new player to create a character on it.

The graph updates every 3 minutes so it should allow you to quickly know when the sietch you want is open. Good luck sleepers!
